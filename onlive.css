-How to use Custom CSS for the GamePad Viewer-
https://gamepadviewer.com/

Enabling a custom CSS is as easy as adding &css=[url to css file]
to the end of the url like so:
https://gamepadviewer.com/?p=1&css=https://gist.github.com/anonymous/526491dc02014099cd14/raw/d7bb0477ba984f794497f3f0f82cb33484dc7889/ps3.css

If you're going to be using custom CSS for the gamepad viewer
to design your own skin, we're assuming you have some sort of
basic knowledge on how CSS works. I'd also suggest uploading
your custom CSS to GitHub's gist as you can easily get the
direct link for the file by copying the link address on the
"Raw" button at the top right of the code.
NOTE: If you're using gist, MAKE SURE TO NAME YOUR CSS FILE!
It doesn't matter what you call it, so long as it ends in .css
else the site won't read it and think it's just a plain text.

Each CSS entry must be preceded by '.custom' since that's the 
hardcoded class for a custom style. It doesn't make sense to 
change this as you can only have one custom skin loaded at a time.

If you're using images, they have to be uploaded to an image host of
your choice. Personally, I'd go with Imgur since it's simple to upload
and get the direct URL of the image. None of the images in this example
will load because they're pointing to a location relative of the css 
files, since this is normally in the main CSS file of the site.

The following is a copy of the code used for displaying the PS3 controller
skin on the Gamepad viewer. You can scroll below and read the comments to
get an understanding of how the styling works and whatnot. Happy skinning!

P.S. If you use this tool often and would like to 'buy me a coffee' you can
